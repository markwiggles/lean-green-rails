		p When most people think of the word diet, they think of something people go on for a short period of time to lose weight. However the actual meaning of the word diet would be better described as the kinds of foods a person or community habitually eat.
		p The Standard  Australian Diet (what most people in our community consider normal eating) is unfortunately far from optimal for long-term health and wellness. Our food courts and supermarkets are filled with overweight adults and kids. Our lunch boxes are full of white bread, processed ham, antibiotic and hormone-riddled meat, and packaged goods not even fit enough for an ant to eat.
